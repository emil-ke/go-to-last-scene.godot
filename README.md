# Go-To-Last-Scene (Godot Plugin)
This plugin works similarly to Vim's buffer switch command `:b#`.
I.e. with a shortcut (default: `<Ctrl-Shift-L>`) you can hop back
and forth between two scenes.

I use this in conjunction with my keyboard-based scene picker
plugin ([Slippert Scenes](https://github.com/emil-ke/slippery-scenes-godot)).
